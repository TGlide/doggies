This is a small demo app to compare Sveltekit's and React RSC's progressive enhancement capabilities. Please note that this is a personal test, and the code here does not reflect these frameworks quality and/or effectiveness.

The Svelte version has extra features, due to my higher experience there:

- Optimistic UI on add action
- Optimistic UI on delete action
- Animations
